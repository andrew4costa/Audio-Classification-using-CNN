# Audio-Classification-using-CNN

This project is the result of my Machine Learning module taking during my Master's. 

We explored audio data from the UrbanSound8K data set publically available and sought to classify the 10 different classes of sound using 
Multi-layer perceptrons and Convolutional Neural Networks.

Additional libraries were used to process the audio data, like Librosa.
